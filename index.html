    <br />
    I'm originally from California, grew up in the Bay Area for a long time.  I served a mission in Washington DC South, and I've mainly been going to school in 
    Idaho since then.  I've worked a few jobs, one of which was as a Software Developer, which was really interesting and good experience.  I like video games a ton, 
    especially programming them, but I'm also into swimming, reading, making videos, camping and hiking, and things like that.  I run a small Youtube channel where I post
    Let's Plays.  It takes a bunch of time and can be tough, but it's great and I'm really glad I get to do it.  It makes people laugh and I'm glad I can do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    Once I'm done with school (should be about April 2016) I'm hoping to get a job that involves developing software.  I'd really like to get into game development, perhaps
    on the indie side, which is why I've started working with a few game development tools.  We'll see what happens though.
